# Weather-Predictor
Developer: Shuaib Ahmed

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a weather predictor using a custom linear regression model built from scratch, along with gradient descent optimization. The predictor aims to forecast weather-related parameters based on historical data. The model was developed using Python, with libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and sklearn utilized for data manipulation, visualization, and comparison.

The main goal of this project was to build a weather predictor using a custom linear regression model implemented with gradient descent. The model was designed to predict weather parameters based on historical data, providing insights into potential future weather conditions.

## Results and Comparison

The developed weather predictor achieved an R-squared value of approximately 0.7, indicating a reasonably good fit to the data. This R-squared value closely aligned with the performance of the linear regression model from sklearn. The similarity in results between the custom model and the sklearn model validates the accuracy of the custom implementation.
